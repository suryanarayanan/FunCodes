a small part of my fun codes that I could save.

Will update this space here after.

1. spam_filter.cc 
   A simple Naive Bayes spam filter which does a reasonable email spam filtering on
   sufficient training.

2. csp.java
   A golumb ruler generater using Constrain Search Propagation. It can easily generate
   optimal golumb ruler of order 12. But struggles after that.

3. bsheep.cc
   graham scan implementation for finding convex hull.

4. my-first-python.py
   A simple interactive tic tac toe in python.

5. maze.cc
   A complex maze simulation of finding targets in a maze in optimal time.
